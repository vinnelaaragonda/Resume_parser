# Resume Parser

This project parses a resume from a DOCX file and extracts various sections such as Name, Contact Information, Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Certifications, Projects, Co-Curricular Activities, and Languages.

## Files

- `Dummy.docx`: A sample resume file used for testing.
- `parse_resume.py`: The Python script that parses the resume and generates a summary.
- `README.md`: This file with instructions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `python-docx` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Install the `python-docx` library if you haven't already:
    ```sh
    pip install python-docx
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have `Dummy.docx` and `parse_resume.py` in the same directory.
2. Run the Python script:
    ```sh
    python parse_resume.py
    ```
3. The script will parse the resume and print the extracted data in JSON format, followed by a short summary.

## Sample Output
